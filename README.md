# Joyput

## What's this?

Back in 2012, I bought [Bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_(video_game))
 which had just been ported to Linux with the help of [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/).
I'm not a huge gamer and I'd much rather play with my PS3 controller than on my 
laptop's keyboard. So I wrote some code that would emulate a keyboard on Linux 
with [UInput](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/uinput.html). All I 
needed to do was read [joystick events](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/joystick.h)
 and translate them into keypresses that Bastion would understand. :-D

## Today

It was kind of playable for a while except with firearms that it was hard to 
actually - you know - point at enemies... Plus Bastion added support for the 
Xbox 360 controller about a week later so it was easier to just go out and buy 
one!
